# Final Project - SKS National Bank Database

This project contains SQL scripts and an ERD for **Phase 1** of the **SKS National Bank Database** project, which covers core banking operations including branches, customers, employees, accounts and loans.

**Note**: This is just **Phase 1**. **Phase 2** will be added later and may include additional tables or queries.

## Phase 1 Contents
1. **ERD** - Shows database relationships.
2. **create_database.sql** - Create the database and all tables with primary/foreign keys.
3. **populate_database.sql** - Insert mock data into all tables.
4. **prepared_queries.sql** - Contains 10 queries to test and demonstrate the database.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and connect to your SQL Server Instance.
3. Run the scripts in order:
   * `create_database.sql`
   *  `populate_database.sql`
   *  `prepared_queries.sql`
4. Verify that all tables are created and populated.

## Notes
* Always run `create_database.sql` before `populate_database.sql`.
* Future updates for **Phase 2** will be added to this repository.
